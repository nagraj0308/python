"""The standard streams available in python are
1-Standard input stream

2-Standard output stream and

3-Standard error stream
These standard streams are nothing but file objects, which get automatically connected to your program's
standard device(s), when you start python. In order to work with standard I/O stream, we need to import
sys module. Methods which are available for I/O operations in it are

1-read() for reading a byte at a time from keyboard
2-write() for writing data on terminal i.e. monitor"""

# Example..
import sys

print("Enter your name..: ")
name = ""
c = sys.stdin.read()
if c == 'a':
    name = name + c
sys.stdout.write("Your Name is: ", name)

# same can be done using high level methods also
name = input('Enter your name :')
print('your name is ', name)
